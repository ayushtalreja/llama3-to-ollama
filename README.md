# Fine-tuning Llama 3 and Deploying to Ollama 🚀

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuning the **Llama 3-8B Instruct** model and converting it for deployment using **Ollama**. It walks through fine-tuning with the **ORPO** method (One-step Reinforcement Preference Optimization), model conversion to **GGUF** format, and the creation of an Ollama `Modelfile` for seamless deployment.

## Key Highlights
- Fine-tune the **Llama 3-8B Instruct** model using **ORPO**, which combines supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization in a single step.
- Convert the fine-tuned model into the efficient **GGUF** format using `llama.cpp`.
- Create an **Ollama Modelfile** to define the deployment pipeline, similar to a Dockerfile but for AI models.
- Push the model to the **Ollama Hub** and perform local inference tests.
- Pull the model from Ollama Hub on another machine and run it for inference.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Llama 3-8B Instruct**
- **ORPO Fine-Tuning Method**
- **llama.cpp** (for model conversion)
- **Ollama** (for model packaging and deployment)

## 📖 Usage Instructions
1. Follow the steps in `llama3-to-ollama.ipynb` to:
   - Fine-tune the Llama 3 model using ORPO.
   - Convert the model into GGUF format.
   - Write and customize your Ollama Modelfile.
   - Test and push your model to Ollama Hub.

2. Pull and run your model on a new machine via Ollama.

## 📌 Requirements
- Python (with typical ML libraries)
- llama.cpp
- Ollama CLI tools
- Access to Ollama Hub (for pushing models)

## 🎯 Goals
This project aims to simplify the fine-tuning and deployment process for LLMs and make it accessible for developers who want to integrate custom models into their applications.
